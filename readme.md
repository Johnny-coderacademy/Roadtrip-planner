## User Interaction & Experience
1. Users are welcome with a colorful logo and greeting message using TTY-prompt, Artii and Lolize gems. 

2. Then users are asked to enter their names, if they enter an empty letter three times, the app will automatically use the default name: "Mysterious One" to continue.

3. After that, TTY-prompt gem is used to display travel options to users, and they can use "->" in green color to select their options. All questions are in white text while selected input will be print out in light blue coloured text.

4. Next, Users are asked to choose their vehicle options either a car or a motorbike. Once they select their vehicle, the programm will display the fuel consumption for every 100km distance. 

5. Follows the vehicle options, there is a "Want to know more questions" using TTY-prompt gem. This is just future funcitons to add more detail on users' trip but if they say "no", the programs will be exited. If they say "yes" a TTY-progress bar will appear and a sorry message to display.

6. After users have selected their vehicle and travel options, they can use a calculator to find out how much money they need to spend on fuel. While calculating, a progress bar display.

7. Finally, an Exit option located at the bottom will allow users to quit the program once they finish their trip selection.
